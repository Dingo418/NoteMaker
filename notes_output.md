### History of Computer Science
- **Founders**: 
  - **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**: Creator of binary number system, known as the "founder of computer science".
  - **Charles Babbage**: Referred to as the "father of computing".
  - **Ada Lovelace**: Author of the first algorithm for computers.
  
- Historical foundations:
  - Early calculating machines (e.g., **abacus**) date back to antiquity.
  
- **Key Developments**:
  - **Wilhelm Schickard**: First working mechanical calculator (1623).
  - **Gottfried Leibniz**: Stepped Reckoner (1673).
  - **Thomas de Colmar**: Industrialized mechanical calculators (1820).
  - **Charles Babbage**: 
    - Designed the **Difference Engine** (1822).
    - Developed the **Analytical Engine** (1834).
    - Adopted **punched card system** for programmability.
  - **Ada Lovelace**: First published algorithm (Bernoulli numbers, 1843).
  - **Herman Hollerith**: Invented tabulator using punched cards for statistics.

- **Subsequent Innovations**:
  - **Leonardo Torres Quevedo**: Theoretical electromechanical calculating machine (1914).
  - **Howard Aiken**: Developed ASCC/Harvard Mark I (1937) based on Babbage's designs.

- **1940s and Beyond**:
  - Advanced computing machines like **Atanasoff-Berry computer** and **ENIAC** redefine 'computer' to refer to machines.
  - 1945: IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory.
  - Emergence of computer science as a distinct academic discipline in the **1950s**.
  - **Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science**: World's first computer science degree (1953).
  - **Purdue University**: First computer science department in the U.S. (1962).
