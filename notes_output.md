- **History of Computer Science**: 
  - Began before modern discipline, existed in **mathematics** and **physics**.
  - Showed progression from **mechanical inventions** and **mathematical theories** to **modern computer concepts** and **machines**.
  - Resulted in:
    - Major **academic field** development.
    - Massive **technological advancement** in the Western world.
    - Basis for a **worldwide trade** and **culture**.

- **Prehistory**:
  - **John Napier** (1550–1617): Inventor of **logarithms**.
  - Earliest computation tool: **abacus**, developed between **2700 and 2300 BCE** in **Sumer**.
    - Structure: Table of columns representing **sexagesimal number system** orders.
    - Original usage: Lines in **sand with pebbles**. 

[End of Notes]- In the **5th century BC**, Pāṇini, a grammarian, created the **grammar of Sanskrit**.  
  - Comprised of **3959 rules** known as the **Ashtadhyayi**.  
  - The work was **highly systematized** and **technical**.  
  - Utilized **metarules**, **transformations**, and **recursions**.

- The **Antikythera mechanism** is considered an early **mechanical analog computer**.  
  - Designed to **calculate astronomical positions**.  
  - Discovered in **1901** in the **Antikythera wreck** near the Greek island of Antikythera (between Kythera and Crete).  
  - Dated to around **100 BC**.

- Mechanical analog computers re-emerged in the **medieval Islamic world**.  
  - Developed by Muslim astronomers.  
    - Example: **Mechanical geared astrolabe** by **Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī**.
    - Example: **Torquetum** by **Jabir ibn Aflah**.  
  - **Simon Singh** states that Muslim mathematicians advanced in **cryptography**.  
    - Notable contributions include **cryptanalysis** and **frequency analysis** by **Alkindus**.

[End of Notes]- **Technological artifacts** of similar complexity appeared in **14th century Europe**.
- **Mechanical astronomical clocks** were significant inventions during this time.
- **John Napier** discovered **logarithms** for computational purposes in the **early 17th century**.
- This discovery led to considerable progress in developing **calculating tools**.
- In **1623**, **Wilhelm Schickard** designed a calculating machine called the **Calculating Clock** for **Johannes Kepler**.
- Schickard abandoned the project when the prototype was destroyed by a **fire in 1624**.
- Around **1640**, **Blaise Pascal**, a prominent French mathematician, constructed a mechanical adding device based on a design by **Hero of Alexandria**.
- In **1672**, **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** invented the **Stepped Reckoner**, completing the device in **1694**.
- In **1837**, **Charles Babbage** first described his **Analytical Engine**, recognized as the first design for a **modern computer**.

[End of Notes]- The **design** mentioned was never built, yet it has been extensively studied.
- It is understood to be **Turing equivalent**, indicating its theoretical capability for computation.
- The **analytical engine** would have had:
  - A memory capacity of **less than 1 kilobyte**.
  - A clock speed of **less than 10 Hertz**.
- Significant advancement in **mathematics** and **electronics theory** was necessary for the design of the first modern computers.
