- **Computer Science Definition**  
  - Study of **computation**, **information**, and **automation**.  
  - Includes both **theoretical** (algorithms, theory of computation, information theory) and **applied disciplines** (hardware and software design).

- **Core Areas of Computer Science**  
  - **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Central to the field.  
  - **Theory of Computation**: Examines abstract models and solvable problem classes.  
  - **Cryptography and Security**: Secure communication and vulnerability prevention.  
  - **Computer Graphics**: Image generation.  
  - **Programming Language Theory**: Describes computational processes.  
  - **Database Theory**: Manages data repositories.  
  - **Human-Computer Interaction**: Mechanisms for human-computer interfaces.  
  - **Software Engineering**: Focuses on software design principles.  
  - **Operating Systems, Networks, Embedded Systems**: Principles of complex systems.  
  - **Computer Architecture**: Construction of computer components.  
  - **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: Goal-oriented processes, problem-solving, and adaptation. Includes subfields like **computer vision** and **natural language processing**.

- **Limitations and Recognition**  
  - Fundamental concern: Determining automation boundaries.  
  - **Turing Award**: Highest distinction in the field.

- **History of Computer Science**  
  - **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**: Developed binary logic, termed the "founder of computer science."  
  - **Charles Babbage**: Known as the "father of computing." Designed Difference Engine and Analytical Engine.  
  - **Ada Lovelace**: Published first algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers.  
  - **Early Developments**: Machines like abacuses, mechanical calculators (Schickard and Leibniz), tabulators (Hollerith).  
  - **Later Advances**: Torres Quevedo's Essays on Automatics and floating-point arithmetic; IBM developments with the ASCC/Harvard Mark I.

- **Modern Era**  
  - 1940s: Shift from human to machine computation.  
  - IBM's Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory: Catalyst for the new discipline.  
  - 1950s-60s: Establishment of computer science as an academic discipline.  
  - 1953: First computer science program at Cambridge University.  
  - 1962: First US computer science department at Purdue University.  
  - Evolution into distinct areas of study with available practical computers.
